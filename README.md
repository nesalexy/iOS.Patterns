# There are such groups of templates: 

1. Generating patterns:

- Singleton - ensures that only one instance of a class is created.
- Factory Method - defines an interface for creating objects, but delegates the creation decision to subclasses.
- Builder - allows you to create complex objects step-by-step.
- Prototype - creates new objects by copying an existing object.

2. Structural patterns:
- Adapter - converts the interface of one class into the interface of another class.
- Decorator - dynamically adds functionality to an object.
- Composite - provides a hierarchy of objects that can be treated as a whole.
- Facade - provides a simple interface to access a complex system.

3. Behavioral patterns:
- Command - encapsulates a request and allows it to be deferred, reassigned, or executed.
- Observer - defines dependencies between objects so that when one object changes, other objects are automatically updated.
- Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and allows them to be interchanged.
- State - allows an object to change its behavior depending on its internal state.

4. Architectural patterns:
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) - divides an application into three parts: model, view, and controller.
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter) - divides the application into three parts: model, view, and presenter.
- MVVM (Model-View-View-ViewModel) - divides the application into three parts: model, view and ViewModel.
